**Overview:** <br>
The dynamic taxi fare prediction machine learning project aims to predict the fare of a taxi ride based on various parameters like distance, time, location, and weather conditions. The project uses the "rideshare_kaggle.csv" dataset, which contains information about various taxi rides. The project uses Python as the programming language and several libraries such as PyCaret, Streamlit, Git, and Excel to develop the machine learning model and deploy it. Predicting the appropriate taxi fare using the past data of Boston Uber and Lyft dataset which consists of Taxi ride variables as well as weather variables. When the input of criteria is given, then the app should predict the appropriate fare with regard to the company, customers and to the cab-partners.

The dataset can be found in "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brllrb/uber-and-lyft-dataset-boston-ma"

**Technical Stack:** <br>
**PyCaret:** PyCaret is a Python library that simplifies the process of building, training, and deploying machine learning models. It provides several tools and functions for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

**Streamlit:** Streamlit is an open-source framework for building web applications. It provides an easy-to-use interface for data visualization and model deployment.

**Git:** Git is a version control system that allows developers to collaborate on code and track changes.

**Excel:** Excel is a spreadsheet program that is used for data manipulation and analysis.

**Steps Involved in the Project:** <br> 
**Data Cleaning:** The first step in any machine learning project is to clean the data. The rideshare_kaggle.csv dataset may contain missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data. These issues must be addressed before building the model.

**Data Exploration:** The next step is to explore the data and understand the relationships between different variables. This step involves visualizing the data and analyzing the correlations between variables.

**Feature Engineering:** Feature engineering involves creating new features from existing ones to improve the performance of the model. This step may involve creating new variables such as time of day, day of the week, and weather conditions.

**Model Selection and Training:** PyCaret provides several functions for model selection and training. These functions allow developers to experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to find the best model.

**Model Evaluation:** Once the model is trained, it must be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. PyCaret provides several functions for model evaluation.

**Model Deployment:** Finally, the model must be deployed using Streamlit. Streamlit provides an easy-to-use interface for deploying the model as a web application.

**Conclusion:** <br>
The dynamic taxi fare prediction machine learning project is an exciting project that involves several steps, including data cleaning, data exploration, feature engineering, model selection and training, model evaluation, and model deployment. The project uses several tools and libraries such as PyCaret, Streamlit, Git, and Excel to develop the machine learning model and deploy it.
